    "# Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification. The goal is to predict the probability that a given input belongs to one of two classes (e.g. 0 or 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does Logistic Regression work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linear combination of inputs is calculated\n",
    "2. The linear combination of inputs is passed through a sigmoid function to map the result to a value between 0 and 1\n",
    "3. To make a classfication, a threshold is set, if larger than threshold it is 1, if less it is 0\n",
    "4. Training the model\n",
    "5. Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages vs Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**\n",
    "1. Simple\n",
    "2. Efficient (less computer resources used)\n",
    "3. Easy to interpret\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Poor performance when large sets of features\n",
    "2. Outliers can potentially impact the decision threshold\n",
